## Strategic Parameters

| Parameter | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Launch approach | Demo-Led Viral Launch |
| Timeline | 2-4 weeks (fast launch) |
| Budget | $500-1,500/month |
| Primary goal | Free trial signups (no-card, 3 sessions) |
| PR scope | Aviation media only (Phase 1) |
| Tagline | "Your DPE is ready when you are." |
| Sub-tagline | "Let's talk!" |
| Domain | Secured |
| Existing network | Small but engaged audience + industry contacts |

## Approach Selected

**Demo-Led Viral Launch** — The voice interaction IS the marketing. One 60-90s demo video, deployed across every channel simultaneously on launch day with channel-specific framing.

Why: HeyDPE's differentiator is experiential (voice). No text-based competitor can create the same "whoa" moment. The demo gets reshared; pilots send it to study partners; CFIs forward to students.

## Buyer Personas

1. **Pre-Checkride Alex** (70% of signups) — Student pilot 2-6 weeks from checkride, anxious about oral
2. **Rating-Stacker Jordan** (20%) — Experienced pilot adding IR/CPL, wants efficiency and scoring depth
3. **Recommender CFI Sam** (amplifier) — Active CFI who recommends to students, drives 30%+ of signups

## Channel Strategy (Priority Order)

1. **Tier 1 (Launch Day):** Reddit (r/flying, r/studentpilots, r/aviation), personal CFI network, aviation forums
2. **Tier 2 (Week 1-2):** Google Ads Search — high-intent checkride keywords ($500-800/mo)
3. **Tier 3 (Week 2-3):** Aviation PR — AVweb, AOPA, Flying Magazine, podcast outreach
4. **Tier 4 (Week 3+):** YouTube content, ongoing Reddit engagement, email nurture, CFI referral seeding

## Month 1 Targets

| Metric | Conservative | Stretch |
|--------|------------:|--------:|
| Trial signups | 200 | 450 |
| Trial-to-paid conversion | 8% | 15% |
| Paid subscribers | 16 | 68 |
| MRR | $624 | $2,652 |
